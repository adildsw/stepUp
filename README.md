<b>StepUp</b> is an iOS pedometer application capable of not only recording the number of steps you've walked, but also the nature of your movement - <i>idle, walking, running, </i>or <i>jumping</i>.

## Getting Started
The following set of instructions will help you get StepUp up and running on your iOS smartphone.

### Prerequisites
In order to build and run this application on your device, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:
##### 1. An iPhone running on iOS 14 or later.
##### 2. A computer running on MacOS 10.15.4 or later
##### 2. Xcode 12.4 or later.

### Building StepUp
Once all the prerequisites are met, follow these instructions to build and install StepUp on your device:
##### 1. Clone StepUp repository to your local system. 
Open the <i>Terminal</i> window and type the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/adildsw/stepUp
```
##### 2. Open the StepUp project using Xcode.
Navigate to the directory containing the cloned StepUp repository and then open ```StepUp.xcodeproj``` on Xcode.
##### 3. Ensure your Xcode has code signing certificate and provisioning profile set up.
If unsure, refer to [this link](https://ioscodesigning.com/generating-code-signing-files/) to know more about creating code signing certificate and setting up provisioning profile on Xcode.
##### 4. Plug in a compatible iPhone and press the ```Build``` button.
Make sure that the connected device is selected as the build destination before initiating the build.

If the instructions specified above are followed correctly, StepUp should be up and running on the connected iPhone device.

**NOTE:** While this installs StepUp on the connected iPhone, if the signing certificate/provisioning profile is not generated by an account subscribed to Apple's Developer Program, the application will become unusable after 6 days and will have to be build again for continued usage.

### Using StepUp

StepUp monitors the user's movement only when the ```Play``` button is tapped. Similarly, tapping the ```Pause``` button pauses the movement monitor. The ```Reset``` button stops the movement monitor, clears the graph, and resets the step counter.

**NOTE:** The device is supposed to be kept on hand facing the user (as illustrated in the Figure above) for StepUp to be able to accurately record the step count instantaneously.

## Methodology

StepUp uses readings from the device's accelerometer and passes them through a thresholding-based algorithm to understand the user's movement. For more details, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/adildsw/stepUp/blob/main/Assets/_S21___CS_6501___EIT__Assignment_2__Build_a_Pedometer%20(1).pdf).
